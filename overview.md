# App Brief #

Ketchup is a version control app that allows you to keep your "Sauce" code versioned. It’s main user base would be developers or anybody that does iterative work and half a brain. Think of it as the best thing since sliced bread.

- Usable commit screen to review files, enter a commit message and diff changes against **BASE**
- Ability to roll common functionality like Add, Commit and Push into a single command
- Inline editing of text files in the diff viewer (ABHI: is this a priority?)
- Drag a folder onto the dock icon to open that folder in Ketchup
- Put it on the App Store
- Choose a news outlet like theverge, arstechnica, macstories, macworld etc and put an embargo on the app (get one of them to exclusively cover it and involve them in final builds before offering it to the public). Lex Friedman (Unprofessional/MacWorld) suggested this one.

## Advantage over competitors:
- Simplicity
- It works exactly how we want
- You get SVN and Git support in one app.

## Other possible features: 
- Open a folder in Ketchup from Terminal.app by typing `kcommit .` or `kcommit /Library/WebServer/Documents/sequelpro.com/`

## Other avenues to explore:
- Integration with text editors (what's involved?)
- Integration with Github (anything special? octokit?)

## Competitors:
### Github for Mac (Github)
http://mac.github.com
**Good:**
- Nice icon
- Inline version updates
- Nice commit window
- combined commit + push
- integrated with github

**Bad:**
- No SVN support
- rest of the app is poorly executed

### Versions (Black pixel)
http://versionsapp.com
**Good:**
- Nice timeline view
- Good amount of features, maybe too many?

**Bad:**
- Modal commit window

### XCode VCS
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

**Good:**
- Great Diff
- Nice file list, commit message and diff in one view
- great editor

**Bad:**
- Slow giant modal (IMO)
- Not a stand alone app
- Only works with Obj-C code really..
