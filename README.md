## Compiling Ketchup

Clone the project by running `git clone git@github.com:mattlangtree/ketchup.git` in Terminal.app.

The project Ketchup.xcodeproj can be opened in XCode and you can build the app by pressing the Run button.

No other steps are (currently) needed to compile the app.

## Using Ketchup

The main use case is to drag a folder of any git/svn repository onto the Dock icon of Ketchup to bring up the commit window.
